Building a kinematics chain
===========================

Objective
---------
Build a biped robot by assembling joints and links

Displaying objects
------------------
Open a python terminal and go to the project directory.
By typing CTRL+SHIFT+T in the terminal, you can open another terminal in the
same window.

In the first terminal, type
[source,sh]
----
source config.sh
gepetto-gui
----
A window opens that we call the viewer.

In the second terminal, type
[source,python]
----
source config.sh
python -i example_display.py
----

You should see three objects in the viewer: a sphere, a box and a cylinder.

Look at the code in files

* +display.py+,
* +example_display.py+

Building a kinematic chain
--------------------------

In the first terminal, type
[source,sh]
----
gepetto-gui
----

In the second terminal, type
[source,python]
----
python -i example_robot.py
----

You should see a kinematic chain moving with constant joint velocity

Look at the code in files

* +robot_arm.py+,
* +example_robot.py+

Exercise 1.1
------------

image::biped-robot.png[width="15%",alt="biped robot"]

Build a kinematic chain composed of a trunc and two legs with six degrees of
freedom each. Each leg will be composed of the following joints

* a rotation joint around z axis (hip),
* a rotation joint around y axis (hip),
* a rotation joint around x axis (hip),

* a rotation joint around y axis  (knee),

* a rotation joint around y axis (ankle),
* a rotation joint around x axis (ankle).

Write your code in file +legged_robot.py+.

Exercise 1.2
------------

Append your kinematic chain to 3 prismatic joints

* a prismatic joint along x,
* a prismatic joint along y,
* a prismatic joint along z.

Use +JointModelPX+,+JointModelPY+,+JointModelPZ+ from module +pinocchio+.
